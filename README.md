## Quickstart
```
$ cd cmd/gaze
$ go run main.go

## Options
Use params to improve your experience.
  - To set Heigth: -h <SIZE_IN_INTEGER>
  - To set Weigth: -w <SIZE_IN_INTEGER>

Example: 
```
$ go run main.go -h 12 -w 12

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks ran on the following hardware: 

MacBook Pro 2014, OS X 10.9, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3.

Algorithm | Size | Iterations | ns/ops | ms/op | allocs/op
----------|-------|------|-----------|---------|-----------
Backtracking | 1000x500 | 1 | 5309771223 | 5309.77 | 1002
Prim | 1000x500 | 10 | 118249945 | 118.24 | 1055533
DeadEndFiller | 1000x500 | 10 | 192385091 | 192.38 | 2004517

While Prim is an order of magnitude faster, the memory allocations is still room for much improvement.


## Development

### Terminologies
1. [board](https://github.com/wliao008/gaze/blob/master/board.go): imagine a `width` by `height` 2D array, this represents the graphical layout of the maze.
2. [cell](https://github.com/wliao008/gaze/blob/master/cell.go): each item in the 2D array is a cell. Imagine a cell in the middle of a board, this cell could open passage(s) to the neighboring cells in any or all 4 of the directions, this is what essentially creates the maze when all the cells are processed.
3. [direction](https://github.com/wliao008/gaze/blob/master/direction.go): the 4 directions that a cell could open a passage into.

### Algorithms
There are many ways to generate a maze, the [algos](https://github.com/wliao008/gaze/tree/master/algos) package will contains all the different implementation. All of them implements the [Mazer](https://github.com/wliao008/gaze/blob/master/mazer.go) interface that contains the `Generate()` method that new  algorithm would need to implement.

### Solvers
There are also many ways to solve a maze, these are collected in [solvers](https://github.com/wliao008/gaze/tree/master/solvers).
